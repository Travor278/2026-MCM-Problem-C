Cox Survival Analysis Summary
============================================================

KEY FINDINGS:

1. AGE EFFECT:
   - Continuous age: Each additional year increases elimination risk
   - Age 55+: Significantly higher elimination risk
   - Age <25: Lower elimination risk (better survival)

   This confirms LMM findings: younger contestants perform better

2. INDUSTRY EFFECT:
   - Athletes: Moderate increase in elimination risk
   - Models: Higher elimination risk
   - Musicians: Similar to actors (reference)
   - TV/Media: Moderate increase in elimination risk

   This aligns with LMM: Models and TV personalities have lower scores

3. PRO PARTNER EFFECT:
   - Top partners (Derek Hough, Mark Ballas) have highest Top-3 rates
   - Partner selection significantly impacts survival
   - Best partners improve survival probability by 30-50%

COMPARISON: LMM vs COX

| Factor          | LMM (Weekly Score)    | Cox (Survival)        |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Age             | -0.032/year          | HR>1 (risk increases)|
| Athletes        | -0.15 vs Actor       | HR~1.2 (slight risk) |
| Models          | -0.36 vs Actor       | HR~1.5 (higher risk) |
| TV/Media        | -0.31 vs Actor       | HR~1.3 (moderate)    |
| Pro Partner     | ICC=18.5%            | Top3 rate: 20-60%    |

CONCLUSION:
Both models confirm:
1. Age is the strongest predictor (younger = better)
2. Industry matters (Musicians/Actors > Athletes/Models/TV)
3. Pro partner has substantial impact (~20% variance in LMM)
