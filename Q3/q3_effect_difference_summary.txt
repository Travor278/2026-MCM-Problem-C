==================================

1. AGE EFFECT:
   - Age has STRONGER negative effect on Judge Score than on Fan Vote
   - Judges penalize older contestants more than fans do
   - Difference is statistically significant

2. INDUSTRY EFFECTS:
   - Athletes: Judges are harsher than fans (significant)
   - Models: Both judges and fans rate lower, but judges even more so
   - Musicians: Similar treatment by judges and fans

3. STAGE EFFECT (week/stage_ratio):
   - Fan vote share concentrates as competition progresses
   - This mechanical effect is stronger for fans than for judges

4. INTERACTION EFFECTS (Age × Industry):
   - Young Athletes: Judges favor, Fans neutral
   - Old Models: Both disfavor, especially judges
   - Young Musicians: Both favor strongly
   - Old TV personalities: Fans show more sympathy than judges

CONCLUSION:
- Judges and fans DO NOT weight features the same way
- Key differences: Age penalty (judges > fans), Industry bias varies
- Fans show more "sympathy" for underdogs (older, less skilled)
