Dynamic Control Model - Recommendation
============================================================

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM: Sigmoid Dynamic Weight

Parameters:
- w_min = 0.20 (Early weeks: low judge weight, protect "dark horses")
- w_max = 0.70 (Late weeks: high judge weight, ensure skill-based winner)
- k = 0.50 (Transition speed)

Formula:
w(t) = 0.20 + (0.70 - 0.20) / (1 + exp(-0.50 * (t - t_mid) / (t_max/4)))

Performance:
- Fairness: 0.967 (Higher = eliminated contestants had lower judge scores)
- Robbery Rate: 2.6% (Lower = fewer top-scoring contestants eliminated)
- Engagement: 0.530 (Higher = more fan influence)

WHY ADOPT THIS SYSTEM:

1. EARLY SEASON BENEFITS (w ≈ 0.2):
   - Protects entertaining but less skilled contestants
   - Maintains viewer interest with unexpected outcomes
   - Gives celebrities time to improve

2. LATE SEASON BENEFITS (w ≈ 0.7):
   - Ensures champion is truly skilled
   - Prevents "Bobby Bones" scenarios
   - Maintains competition integrity

3. GRADUAL TRANSITION:
   - Smooth change avoids sudden rule shifts
   - k = 0.50 provides balanced transition
   - Viewers can anticipate changing dynamics

COMPARISON WITH CURRENT SYSTEM (w=0.5 fixed):
- Similar fairness level
- Lower robbery rate (better)
- Higher fan engagement (better)
- More strategic depth for viewers
