QUESTION 4: RECOMMENDED VOTING SYSTEM
============================================================

PROPOSED SYSTEM: Dynamic Sigmoid Weight

FORMULA:
w(t) = 0.20 + 0.50 / (1 + exp(-0.50 * (t - t_mid) / (t_max/4)))

Where:
- t = current week
- t_max = total weeks in season
- t_mid = t_max / 2 (midpoint)

WEIGHT SCHEDULE (11-week season):
Week 1-3:  w ≈ 0.25-0.35 (Fan-Heavy)
Week 4-6:  w ≈ 0.40-0.50 (Balanced)
Week 7-9:  w ≈ 0.55-0.60 (Judge-Leaning)
Week 10-11: w ≈ 0.65-0.70 (Judge-Heavy)

VALIDATION RESULTS:

1. BOBBY BONES SCENARIO:
   - Under current system: Won despite low judge scores
   - Under proposed system: Would face higher elimination risk in later weeks
   - Conclusion: System prevents skill-poor winners while protecting
     entertainment in early weeks

2. JERRY RICE SCENARIO:
   - Strong athlete who improved throughout season
   - Both systems protected him early, rewarded skill later
   - Conclusion: System supports "improvement arcs"

3. ROBBERY REDUCTION:
   - Current system: 5 cases of top-2 judge scorer eliminated
   - Proposed system: 4 cases
   - Reduction: 1 fewer (20% decrease)

WHY PRODUCERS SHOULD ADOPT THIS:

1. ENTERTAINMENT VALUE:
   - Early weeks protect entertaining "underdogs"
   - Creates compelling "redemption arc" narratives
   - Viewers feel their votes matter most when it's fun

2. COMPETITION INTEGRITY:
   - Late weeks ensure skilled dancers advance
   - Champion has proven dance ability
   - Avoids "Bobby Bones" PR disasters

3. STRATEGIC DEPTH:
   - Contestants know rules change → adapt strategies
   - Creates natural "story beats" in the season
   - More interesting for superfans to analyze

4. EASY IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Only requires changing weight calculation
   - No new infrastructure needed
   - Can be explained simply to viewers

ALTERNATIVE ENHANCEMENTS:

A. Judge Save Power (in addition to dynamic weight):
   - Judges can "save" one bottom-2 contestant per season
   - Prevents single-week flukes from eliminating strong dancers

B. Viewer Ranking (simplified Condorcet):
   - Ask viewers to rank top 3 favorites
   - Weights: 3 points for #1, 2 for #2, 1 for #3
   - Captures intensity of preference
